										<h2>Survival of the Terms After Agreement Ends</h2>
										<p>Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Terms of Use, or any general legal principles to the contrary, any provision of these Terms of Use that imposes or contemplates continuing obligations on a party will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms of Use.</p>
	
										<h2>Force Majeur</h2>
										<p>Boujee Bin shall be excused from performance under these Terms of Use or the Terms of Membership, to the extent it is prevented from or delayed from performing, in whole or in part, as a result of an event or series of events caused by or resulting from (1) weather conditions or other elements of nature or acts of God, (2) acts of war, acts of terrorism, insurrection, riots, civil disorders or rebellion, (3) quarantines or embargoes, (4) labor strikes, or (5) other causes beyond the reasonable control of Boujee Bin.</p>
	
										<h2>International Use</h2>
										<p>We make no representation that information available in connection with the Site is appropriate or available for use outside the United States.

										<h2>Risk of Loss</h2>
										<p>The items purchased through the Site are shipped by a third party carrier pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.</p>
	
										<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
										<p>By using the Site in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Boujee Bin, or any of its officers, directors and employees, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Site or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in New York, New York; (4) the arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by these Boujee Bin Terms of Use and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Site; (5) the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Boujee Bin, or any of its officers', directors', and employees', individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or Boujee Bin, or any of its officers, directors, and employees; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against Boujee Bin or any of its officers, directors and employees, exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, Boujee Bin agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Boujee Bin will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this Dispute Resolution provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor Boujee Bin shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. For more information on JAMS and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their website at www.jamsadr.com. THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN JAMS RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR Boujee Bin WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.</p>
	
										<h2>General</h2>
										<p>From time to time, Boujee Bin may offer special promotional offers that may or may not apply to your Boujee Bin account. You agree to be bound by any additional terms and conditions for these special offers.</p>
	
										<p>If any of the provisions set forth in these Terms of Use or the Terms of Membership are deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the unenforceable condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions of these Terms of Use or the Terms of Membership. Section headings are for reference purposes only and do not limit the scope or extent of such section. These Terms of Use or the Terms of Membership and the relationship between you and Boujee Bin will be governed by the laws of the State of New York, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  For any actions not subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in New York County, New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
	
										<p>The failure of Boujee Bin to act with respect to a breach of these Terms of Use or the Terms of Membership by you or others does not waive Boujee Bin’s right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. If any content on this Site, or your use of the Site, is contrary to the laws of the place where you are when you access it, the Site is not intended for you, and we ask you not to use the Site. You are responsible for informing yourself of the laws of your jurisdiction and complying with them.</p>

It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we make to the Terms of Use. Your continued use of this Site after any changes to the Terms of Use means you accept the changes.</p>
	
										<h2>Assignment</h2>
										<p>You may not assign these Terms of Use or the Terms of Membership (or any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder) by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of Boujee Bin, which may be withheld at Boujee Bin’s sole discretion. Any attempted assignment that does not comply with these Terms of Use or the Terms of Membership shall be null and void. Boujee Bin may assign these Terms of Use or the Terms of Membership, in whole or in part, to any third party in its sole discretion.</p>
	
										<h2>Entire Agreement and Admissability</h2>

For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms of Use apply solely to the extent permitted by law.</p>
	
										<p>In some instances, both of these Terms of Use and a separate document that provides additional conditions may apply to a service or product offered via this Site (“Additional Terms”).
